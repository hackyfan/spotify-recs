Actions:
input a related artist and get a list of up to ten, or however many you specify, related artists
input a song and get the spotify analysis of its mood, poppiness, bounciness, etc
you're also able to get a list of songs with similar spotify analysis by the related artist of the singer

Unfortunately this no longer works. It relied on song_analysis() and recommend(), functions that the Spotify WebAPI no longer supports. RIP!
