Unfortunately this no longer works. It relied on audio_analysis() and audio_features(), functions that the Spotify WebAPI no longer supports as of 11/2024. RIP! 


Available Actions:
Input a related artist and get a list of up to ten, or however many you specify, related artists
Input a song and get the spotify analysis of its mood, poppiness, bounciness, etc
You're also able to get a list of songs with similar spotify analysis by the related artist of the singer


Requires: Python, spotipy
